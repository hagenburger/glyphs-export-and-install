# Export and install fonts from Glyphs.app

Installing fonts on MacOS sometimes is tricky, as fonts stay cached in the old
version, even when installing a new one.

This script solves caching issues.

1. Exports all active instances of a font
2. Deletes (uninstalls) older versions of each instance
3. Renames the exported fonts to `OriginalName-20180212-2234.otf` (including the
   current time to avoid caching issues)
4. Installs the new version into `~/Library/Fonts`

Before running this script the first time, use Glyph.appâ€™s export function at
least once. The configuration is kept.
